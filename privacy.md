As a cybersecurity professional, I (the site owner) am conscious of privacy concerns; and as an analytical person, I am also aware of the power of analytics when it comes to continual improvement of the posts and overall website.

That is why I have chosen to use...

## Fathom Analytics

Fathom Analytics **does not use cookies** and complies with the GDPR, ePrivacy (including PECR), COPPA and CCPA.

By using these privacy-friendly analytics, I have **no** way of personally identifying you.

Furthermore, I've chosen to configure Fathom Analytics to respect the "Do Not Track" setting of visitors. Additionally, if you are using an adblocker, it's likely already configured to block Fathom Analytics, which I have chosen to respect as well by not using a custom domain.

You can read more about the privacy-focused features on [Fathom Analytics' website](https://usefathom.com/privacy-focused-web-analytics).

## Cookies

Cookies are **not used** on this website.

## Third-party links

Within this website, there are links to other websites which are not under my control, and therefore, I cannot be responsible for the privacy practices or content of those sites. The inclusion of any links does not necessarily imply a recommendation or endorse the views expressed within them. It is recommended that you review the privacy policies of any linked websites you visit.

I take your privacy very seriously and I reserve the right to update this policy as needed to reflect any changes.
